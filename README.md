<h1>Penguin Drunky project</h1>
<p>A game developed in python during a journey at ESIEE-IT. It also has a web version because I wanted to try to make it all by myself without given ressources</p>
<hr />
<h2>What's the purpose of the project ?</h2>
<p>We were invited me and my friend for a journey at ESIEE-IT a university located in Paris, and during this one we developed a game with a template where we had to modify code etc ... I then decided to make my own version of the project</p>
<h2>What I learnt ?</h2>
<p>How conitnuous events work, how to make a game with vanilla JS. And how absolute/relative position combo works.</p>
